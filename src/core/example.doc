__BEGIN_DOC( candoScript, chapter, Cando Scripting Language)
Cando-Script is a language tailored to constructing and searching oligomer libraries.
Cando-Script is modeled after the languages Lisp and Scheme, not to be different but because
these languages have a simple and compact syntax and they seemed to be a good match for the
problem.\par

Cando-Script is designed to allow a chemists to easily define oligomer libraries, build 3D models of
oligomer libraries, score members of these libraries and identify the best 
oligomer structures to present functional groups
in a desired three-dimensional constellation.\par

Every command has the form: [\textbf{command} \emph{arg1 arg2 arg3 ...} ]

A sample script is shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
[database "../database/_database.xml" ]
[setPartPack 'aaGlu
    [parts
        [addPart 'glu(S) [aliasAtoms 'OE ] ]
        [addPart 'glu(R) [aliasAtoms 'OE ] ]
    ]
    [atomAliases 'carbO ]
]
[setOligomer 'dipeptide
    [:
        [monomer 'a 'aaTyr [monomerAlias 'mon1 ] ]
        [link 'a 'dkp [monomer 'b 'aaTyr [monomerAlias 'mon2 ]]]
    ]
]
[setBuilder 'builder [: dipeptide ] ]
[setGeometryScorer 'scorer
    [comparer
        [distance [alias 'mon1  'carbO] [alias 'mon2 'carbO] 2.0 ]
    ]
]
[setHitList 'hits 1000]
[set 'options [: [: 'useRandomConformations false ] ] ]
[exhaustiveSearch builder scorer hits options ]
[save hits "_hits.xml"]
\end{verbatim}
